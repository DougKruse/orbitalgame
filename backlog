delta diffing
gravity (Not strictly pure realism, more functional and expected. Scales and masses unlikely to be realistic as would leave empty visual space and ill proportions. Orbitals also likely simplified. Multi-body influence on objects still wanted when crutial to immersive simulation) 
Start testing system ideas
start testing weapon ideas
start making race ideas
