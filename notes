Idea is better envisioned as intra-solar system, or like 2 with four players or whatever. Makes having unique planets, position from sun interesting. Outer planets rotate slower. Building up planet or neibohors more drastic, space smaller, more oppositional - better origional intention. Means more complex spacefuckery isnt necissary, just planets / star / asteroids (moons) / debris. Makes debris more threatening, astroids interesting. Race for upgrades, dominante space, offensive rushdown all strats. Issue of parity in orbit speed. Do not want to make start too asymetrical. Perhaps all in same "middle" ring of same exact orbit speed. To easy to hit neibhors / not fun then? Explore. Off by one inverse rotation direction also possible. Either way workable. 

Can have larger spaces between rings then, needed. Need to collapse across system to allow using empty spacce (other half of system)




Shapes being able to get their own center seems crutial for non-symmetrical shapes. (only if their rotation is to be adjusted, which seems a mixed bag, too complicated for good gamesmanship, too complicated if when your planet gets half destroyed your spinning changes immensely or gravity, more likely that just treat as before in this case.
Non symmetrical shapes in general seem like interesting idea for livening up space considering limits on aspect ratio. Like ones that are initially created unsymmetrical.
