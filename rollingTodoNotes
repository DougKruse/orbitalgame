World builder.
	Astroid cloud, mixed rings (asteroids and planets)
	Special Asteroids (different shape)
	
	

Stop player object flying into mars
	Re-add firing as button

Gravity changes
	Elastic function speeds up those with slightly lower orbit radius, needs to just flex orbit (and likely track what it should be)
	cheat a *lot* more as far as orbits. We want them not to fall apart *ever* unless something special happens. No decay, cheat, lock (in that force moves to a larger/smaller stable orbit instead of collapsing.
	moons.
	Not affecting players, flags for bodies.
	Sun is 99.8 of mass of solar system. Test what we wan it as.
	bind player to planet, spin, movement, adhere to surface.
	// Test larger systems, holes, multiple suns (nope!)
	Adjust gravity values as needed for correct speed
	Figure how much speed is needed to escape stable orbit
		Apply at vector perpendicular to orbit for honest amount
		Good test for more advanced weapon system
	affectsGravity (boolean): participates in gravity as attractor (true for stars, planets, black hole, not for projectiles/debris)
	isCollidable (boolean): can be hit (true for all except, e.g., forcefield-only objects)
	canBeMoved (boolean): Might need for sun, lets leave until that happens
	Find out how to seed objects into orbit velocity, not manually
		flag on creation


Performance
	Attractors less often, locking if not pushed hard.	
		Assign random attractor value, iterate to 10, flag check at 10.


debris from bites, likely multiple chunks over direct large chunk. Need to fly away from object they came from, not back into it, no celings make this easy, easy to get range of shortened angles.

Weapons
	Explosions causing some force, equal and opposite to debris
	Spawn a thing
	Basic npc
	Items rotating with body they are on,  moving with it, tied to it unless something happens.

Canvas changes	
	x-able to be able to deselect
	Hover highlights body
	add elastic debugging
	Add speed


Figure out UI on canvas (not on canvas! Dom!), what it looks like doing, make workflow for it, etc. Canvas would be prettier, so likely want that. Match Aestetic. Dev ui can be dom of course for ease. This would then need layering. Perhaps overlapping canvas windows, can you do that for ui layer? Probably bad idea, viewport should be able to isolate these two. 

Other interesting shapes: 
	That rounded triangle thing.
	hypershape construct made of joined shapes? This likely works, just need refinement. Likely special class of body has this.

Source non-symmetric shape ideas that still work ok.
